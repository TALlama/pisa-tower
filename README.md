# Pisa: Tools for the Tower

Here's a collection of fun little tools that let you think about [The Tower]

## Tools

- [Pisa](pisa.html) lets you paste in end-of-round stats and shows you nice graphs

## Other Resources

- The [Fandom Wiki](https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tower_-_Idle_Tower_Defense_Wiki) is the most complete resource I've found for Tower resources. It updates quickly. Too bad about the wall-to-wall Fandom ads.
- [J Play's Notion Site](https://the-tower.notion.site/) is an excellent source of hints and strategies.
- The [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTowerGame/) has good info but you should watch out for old posts; they're often wrong about the game as it exists now.
- There's a [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/thetowerdefense) but I've never joined
